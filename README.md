Project Description: Smart Kitchen Management System

The Smart Kitchen Management System is an AI-powered application designed to optimize food usage, reduce waste, and assist users with meal planning. The system leverages computer vision and machine learning to detect, track, and manage kitchen inventory in real time.

At the core of the project is a custom object detection model, trained using YOLOv5/TensorFlow/Keras on a self-curated dataset of common kitchen items such as fruits, vegetables, bottles, and eggs. The system integrates with a live video stream via OpenCV, enabling it to identify and track food items placed within the camera’s view. Detected items are processed to maintain an updated inventory, ensuring accurate tracking of available resources.

One of the unique features of this system is its recipe recommendation engine, built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. The engine dynamically suggests recipes based on the current inventory, providing meal ideas that utilize available ingredients effectively. This not only minimizes food wastage but also helps users plan their meals conveniently. Recommendations are rule-based, but the architecture allows for expansion into more advanced ML-driven personalized suggestions.

For visualization and analytics, the system uses Matplotlib to generate insights such as ingredient usage trends, frequency of item detection, and recipe popularity. The modular design of the project makes it extendable—features like expiry tracking, user preference learning, or integration with IoT devices can be added in future iterations.

Overall, this project demonstrates a practical application of AI in daily life, combining computer vision, inventory management, and intelligent recommendation to create a smart kitchen assistant that is efficient, scalable, and user-friendly.
